# Zk-MerkleTree

A circom circuit implementation of a Merkle Tree. There are two circuits: `Tree.circom` and `TreeChecker.circom`. The `Tree.circom` circuit takes an array of leaves and outputs `true` if the generated root is correct and `false` if it is not. The `TreeChecker.circom` circuit takes an array of leaves and a Merkle Tree root and outputs `true` if the root is valid and `false` if it is not.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer 

This is my first serious attempt at creating a circom circuit. I'm sure there are many ways to improve this implementation. Please feel free to open an issue or PR if you have any suggestions.
